  <ul>
    <li><strong>Phone:</strong> 888-423-3729</li>

  <h2>Common Affirm Issues & Solutions</h2>

  <h3>1. Can't Log In to Affirm Account</h3>
  <p>Make sure you're using the correct phone number or email associated with your account. If you’ve changed your number recently, you may need to contact Affirm directly. Use their official reset form on the login page.</p>

  <h3>2. Affirm Payment Not Showing or Applied</h3>
  <p>Payments may take 1–3 business days to reflect. If you paid via a bank account, it could be pending. Double-check your transaction history. If the issue persists, call their support team.</p>

  <h3>3. How to Change Payment Method</h3>
  <p>Log into your Affirm account, go to the loan or transaction, and choose “Manage Payment Method.” You can add a debit card or bank account. Note: Credit cards are not accepted.</p>

  <h3>4. Affirm Denied My Loan</h3>
  <p>This may happen due to credit history, payment behavior, or recent loan activity. Affirm doesn't offer appeals, but you can try again later. Make sure your credit file is accurate and that your phone and identity info are up to date.</p>
